                A new mentorship initiative for anyone interested in joining the IT industry. Students, career changers or even junior developers.
                This mentorship initiative will involve working together on a project to provide an experience of what software engineering is like. 
                The project can be discussed to align with which software discipline you are interested in and want to explore more of. 
                We are also open to other ideas, so let us know if you have alternatives in mind.
            </p>            
            <p>
                If you are interested, need some advice or have any questions at all, 
                feel free to get in touch with us on <a href="url">[DISCORD/SLACK LINK]</a>. 
                We would love to have a chat and see if we can be of help, or if you just want to get connected!
